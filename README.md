# html-notes
An HTML Extension to support notes and note references

This document is in active development.  Requirements have been created by various
groups such as W3C DPub, the W3C HTML Accessibility Task Force, the W3C ARIA
Working Group, the W3C Accessible Platform Architecture group, and others.  

The basic concept of this HTML extension is that there should be a relatively easy
way to create a reference within a document that dereferences to a note (footnote,
endnote, sidenote). The notes should be semantically rich, so that user agents can
intelligently make them available to the reader of the document.  This includes
exposing the information to accessible technologies (ATs) in a way that can be
easily navigated and understood by AT users.

This work does not yet have a home within the W3C.  Once the authors and
contributors have consensus on basic functionality, they will work to socialize
the proposal with relevant groups.

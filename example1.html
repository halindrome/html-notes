<h2>Here is a section</h2>
<p>There is example content here.  Within the content there are references to various notes.<noteref
note="ex1"></noteref>  These references can be basic or more ornate. 
<noteref note="ex2">Ornate reference</noteref> 
<noteref note="ex3">Second ornate reference</noteref>
</p>
<note type='i' id="ex1">This is note 1 - it was referenced first.</note>
<notegroup type="A" group="secondary">
<note id="ex2">This is a secondary note. It uses letters for identifiers.</note>
<note id="ex3">This is another secondary note.  It also uses letters for identifiers.</note>
</notegroup>
<p>In another paragraph there is yet another reference.<noteref note="ex4"></noteref>  That reference
is to a note that is outside of a notegroup, but it will inherit the settings of the group because
they are already established.</p>
<note id="ex4" group="secondary">This is a third secondary note.</note>
<p>This is a final paragraph to show how notes can be interleaved in the source and still be simple
footnote references.</p>
